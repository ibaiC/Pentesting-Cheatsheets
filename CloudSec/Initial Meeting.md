## Certifications
SureCloud is happy to push for any cloud related certification, regardless as to whether it is a security focus or not. 

## Training
ACloudGuru - General cloud related labs and courses to help prepare for exams and extend overall knowledge.

Limited subscriptions. 

Hide01.ir - Leaked course content. 

## Focus points:

- Sans cloud security pentesting
- Creating guidelines for scoping processes (AWS, Azure and GCP)
- Main Priority - AWS/Azure

Mainly understand experience levels - what interests are. 
Containers etc. 

Set goals to specialise in one area so that you can develop a deeper understanding of one technology. This should help prevent feeling overwhelmed 


## Innovation Day Focus
Use the first couple of days to jump directly on container security and figure out a methodology in order of what we can propose. 
- What are security best practices; 
- Typical security flaws
- What could we offer our clients? 
	- Client would come to us and say we have containers on x,y or z platform with kubernetes. 
- Something like config reviews of AWS/ECS definitions or other things such as docker compose. Reviewing their files to determine their deployment path. 
- Propose security review/pentest for things on containers and their architectures.


Deliverables: 
- Come back with this is what competitors are doing to determine what we can offer ourselves.
- Personal research to determine tooling.

Determine whether it's worth focusing on Docker or a more generalised container security solutions. 

Look into the use of Trivy for docker image vulnerability scanning.
